# Crypto.com---UI-UX-Redesign

Small project done at the beginning of my experience as iOS developer.

In this project I implemented an Unsolicited redesign that I did about the Crypto.com App.

I decided to pick up where I left off, the first commit only meant to create a repository for
what I previously only had locally and to mark what needs to be done from scratch because it has not yet started.
